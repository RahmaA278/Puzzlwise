#### :mag_right: Improve your critical thinking skills with logic grid puzzles :mag:

Test your historical knowledge and sharpen your critical thinking skills with this engaging game application. Immerse yourself in the world of history while tackling logic grid puzzles, a brain-teasing challenge that requires you to deduce relationships between elements based on a set of clues. These puzzles provide an excellent opportunity to practice logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities while exploring historical themes.

### Reason for this project?
There's generally a lack of focus on developing critical thinking skills. This project aims to shift focus towards developing critical thinking skills by gamifying the learning process.

Additionally, I wanted to practice using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build a website. This application uses its own API, using node.js in the backend. It's a good first project to get a handle on how to manoeuvre through pages, add simple features (such as drop down menus, popups, etc.) and build a full backend.

## Frontend
This simple project has a landing page and puzzle page.

## Backend
| Route | Purpose | Parameters |
|:------|---------|------------|
|/clues|Lists all the clues for each of the topics available to play from|none|
|/clues/:topicNum|Lists all the clues for a speciific topic|topic id|
