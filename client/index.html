            <p>You will have a number of clues that will help you work out the grid. If you know that two things are related, you can tick where they intersect. If you know that they are not related, you put a cross! Each box of 9 squares is a separate box, and in those boxes each row and column can only have one tick</p>
            <p>Using the textbook, you can work out who and what the clues are about, and when you tick the right place, you will get a bonus question! If you get it right, I will be able to help out! </p>
